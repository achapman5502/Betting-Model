# Betting-Model

This folder contains the code for my sports betting model. It works by webscraping odds from two different sports betting websites: one that contains odds that are considered to be nearly exact (Pinnacle), and one with odds that have the potential to deviate significantly (Ubet). In its current setup, it searches for positive Expected Value bets for MLB Player Props, but this can very easily be edited for other sports and bet types
